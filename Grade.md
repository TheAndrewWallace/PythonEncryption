Grade: 31/40
Task 1a: Internal Documentation - Excellent Pass (7 Points) - The majority of the code has associated comments that effectively describe the code block. An attempt to justify construct choices has been made but less than a quarter are poorly made choices and/or not effectively justified.


Task 1b: Interactive Menu System - Exceptional Pass+ (10 Points) - The menu system has been implemented and the user can quit from it, which includes a quit verification. The menu system does not allow the user to enter encryption/decryption text when they have not yet setup the person i.d. There are good instructions that tell the user they need to setup the person i.d. if they attempt to add encryption/decryption text before setting it up. When setting up the person i.d., the program does not crash or allow the user to enter an invalid person i.d. The code has been written to a very high standard with good variable names, as well as efficient and robust design and implementation.


Task 1c: Encryption/Decryption System - Exception pass (14 Points) - The code for encryption and decryption has been implemented and basically work. The student has implemented the correct encryption/decryption scenario based upon the last digit of their person i.d. Checks have been made for invalid characters in the encryption/decryption text and it stops all invalid characters.
